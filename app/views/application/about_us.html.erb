	The Kid Report was built to help teachers communicate with parents and to help parents find information when they need it.  Teachers have more time to do what they do best - work with the kids.

	This website was originally built by Web Developer with kids at John Hay Elementary and Kidspace daycare in Seattle.  The site has been helpful to the teachers, so it was recently updated to be open to anyone.  It is available for free to anyone that needs a site for their classroom.  Hopefully it works well for you.

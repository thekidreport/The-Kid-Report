<p>
	The Kid Report was originally built in 2007 and upgraded in December of 2010 to use the latest Ruby on Rails technology.  I originally built the site for my children's teachers and classrooms, it spread a little to other teachers and classrooms in the Seattle area.

	I am a web developer with many years experience building sites for large companies such as ESPN, Microsoft, Disney, as well as many Seattle startups and small businesses.  This site will always be free and free of ads.  The Kid Report is fun to work on, and I am working on it purely to help out teachers and other parents.  Hopefully this helps reduce the amount of paper that gets sent home by the teacher and makes it easier for the parent to find important information when it's needed.

<p>
	The Kid Report was built to help teachers communicate with parents and to help parents find information when they need it.  Teachers have more time to do what they do best - work with the kids.

	This website was originally built by a parent at John Hay Elementary in Seattle.  It is a free site, supported by donations and volunteers.  It is being developed by other's who have kids in school, and it is available, for free, to anyone that needs a site for their classroom.

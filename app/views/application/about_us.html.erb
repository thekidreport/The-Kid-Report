<% @page_title = 'About us' %>
<p>The Kid Report is a not-for-profit website for teachers.&nbsp; It's a service that allows teachers to update parents online and gives parents a place to find information when they need it.<br><br>I am the developer of The Kid Report.&nbsp; It was orginally built in 2007 for my kids and their classrooms, but it has spread organically and grown significantly in the past 3 years, and I am searching for partners to help expand and develop the project. <br><br>I'm looking for professionals who would can contribute in a part-time or short-term basis; specific areas may include promotion, website feature definition, marketing, non-profit management, etc.&nbsp; The Kid Report will not take subscriptions or money, but may take grant funding in the future.&nbsp; It is based on the fundamental belief that teachers should empower parents to help with their kids' education.&nbsp; The effort should not solely rest on the teachers' shoulders, instead it should be shared, with the teachers expertise driving the classroom and curriculum.<br><br>The Kid Report was built through volunteer efforts, using the latest open source technologies.&nbsp; It is used for free by teachers and parents.</p>

<h3>Contributors wanted</h3>
<p>
	If you are interested in contributing, I am looking for help building The Kid Report.  Software developers would be welcome - I have other features in mind, such as a calendar, photo gallery, paypal acceptance (for teachers to receive money from parents for field trips and things).  If you would like to contribute as a developer, just let me know.  I am also looking for someone who is active in the Seattle Education community who likes to blog or network and would like to help raise awareness about the Kid Report and the useful tools that are provided to classrooms and teachers at no cost.  And, I am looking for a graphic designer who would like to donate their time to give The Kid Report a professional image that reflects the importance of educating our kids as a team effort and makes visiting The Kid Report website more aesthetically appealing.  If you can think of other ways to contribute, I'm interested to hear your thoughts.

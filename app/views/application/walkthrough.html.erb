<p>
	The Kid Report was built to help teachers communicate with parents and to help parents find information when they need it.  Teachers have more time to do what they do best - work with the kids.
</p>
<p>
	There are just a few features in the kid report - limited to make it simple to use, but handle the most common issues teachers and parents have.
